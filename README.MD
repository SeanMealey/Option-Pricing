## Financial Concepts

### Option Pricing

An **option** is a financial derivative that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (**call option**) or sell (**put option**) an underlying asset at a specified price (**strike price**) before or at a certain date (**expiration date**).

### The Black-Scholes Model

The **Black-Scholes model** is a mathematical model for pricing European-style options. It calculates the option price by considering factors such as the current stock price, strike price, time to expiration, risk-free interest rate, and volatility of the underlying asset.

The formula for a European call option is:


![Equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?%20C=S_0%20N(d_1)-K%20e%5E%7B-r%20T%7DN(d_2))

For a put option:

![Equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?P=K%20e%5E%7B-r%20T%7DN(-d_2)-S_0%20N(-d_1))

Where:

- ![Equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?S_0)  = Current stock price
- K = Strike price
- T = Time to expiration (in years)
- r = Risk-free interest rate
- ![Equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?%5Csigma%5C) = Volatility of the underlying asset
- ![Equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?N) = Cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution
- ![Equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?%5C;d_1%5C) and ![Equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?%5C;d_2%5C) are calculated as:


![Equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?%5Cbegin%7Balign*%7Dd_1%26%3D%5Cfrac%7B%5Cln(S_0/K)%2B(r%2B%5Csigma%5E2/2)T%7D%7B%5Csigma%5Csqrt%7BT%7D%7D%5C%3Bd_2%26%3Dd_1-%5Csigma%5Csqrt%7BT%7D%5Cend%7Balign*%7D)

### The Greeks

The **Greeks** are measures of the sensitivity of the option price to various factors. They are essential tools for risk management in options trading.

- **Delta (Δ)**: Sensitivity of the option price to changes in the underlying asset's price.
- **Gamma (Γ)**: Rate of change of Delta with respect to changes in the underlying price.
- **Theta (Θ)**: Sensitivity of the option price to the passage of time (time decay).
- **Vega (ν)**: Sensitivity of the option price to changes in the volatility of the underlying asset.
- **Rho (ρ)**: Sensitivity of the option price to changes in the risk-free interest rate.

### Implied Volatility

**Implied Volatility (IV)** is the market's forecast of a likely movement in an asset's price. It is derived from the market price of an option and represents the volatility parameter in the Black-Scholes model that equates the theoretical option price to the market price.

### Volatility Smile

The **Volatility Smile** is a graphical representation showing implied volatility plotted against strike prices. It typically shows that implied volatility is higher for deep in-the-money and out-of-the-money options compared to at-the-money options, creating a smile-like curve.

### Exotic Options

**Exotic Options** are non-standard options that have features making them more complex than commonly traded vanilla options. Examples include American options (which can be exercised at any time before expiration), barrier options, and Asian options.

## How to Use the Website

### Option Pricing Calculator

[http://optionpricingandanalytics.com/](http://optionpricingandanalytics.com/)

This tool allows you to calculate the price and Greeks of European call and put options using the Black-Scholes model.

**Steps**:

1. **Input Parameters**:
   - **Asset Price (S)**: Current price of the underlying asset.
   - **Strike Price (K)**: Price at which the option can be exercised.
   - **Time to Maturity (T)**: Time remaining until the option expires (in years).
   - **Volatility (σ)**: Estimated volatility of the underlying asset (as a decimal).
   - **Risk-Free Rate (r)**: Current risk-free interest rate (as a decimal).

2. **Interactive Sliders**: Use the sliders to adjust input values and observe real-time changes.

3. **Calculate**: Click the **Calculate** button to compute the option price and Greeks.

4. **Results**:
   - **Option Prices**: Displays the calculated prices for call and put options.
   - **Greeks**: Shows the Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, and Rho for both call and put options.
   - **Visualizations**: Interactive charts displaying how the Greeks change with respect to various parameters.

**Visualization Examples**:

- **Delta vs. Stock Price**: Observe how Delta changes as the stock price varies.
- **Gamma vs. Stock Price**: Understand how Gamma behaves with different stock prices.
- **Theta Decay**: See how Theta changes as time to expiration decreases.
- **Vega vs. Stock Price**: Examine Vega's sensitivity to changes in stock price.

### Implied Volatility Calculator


This tool calculates the implied volatility of an option using market data and generates the volatility smile.

**Steps**:

1. **Input Parameters**:
   - **Ticker**: Symbol of the stock (e.g., AAPL, NVDA).
   - **Asset Price (S)**: Will auto-populate when you click **Load** after entering the ticker.
   - **Strike Price (K)**: Specify the strike price of the option.
   - **Days to Expiration (DTE)**: Number of days until the option expires.
   - **Risk-Free Rate (r)**: Risk-free interest rate (auto-fetched or input manually).
   - **Volatility (σ)**: Initial guess for volatility (used in calculations).

2. **Load Data**:
   - Click **Load** to fetch the latest asset price and suggested parameters.

3. **Calculate**:
   - Click **Calculate** to compute the implied volatility.

4. **Results**:
   - **Implied Volatility**: Displays the calculated implied volatility percentage.
   - **Volatility Smile**: Shows a plot of implied volatility against strike prices.

**Understanding the Volatility Smile**:

The plot helps visualize how implied volatility varies with strike prices. A typical volatility smile indicates that implied volatility is higher for deep in-the-money and out-of-the-money options.

### American and Exotic Options Pricing


Calculate prices for American and exotic options using advanced numerical methods.

**Exotic Options Supported**:

- **American Options**: Options that can be exercised at any time before expiration.
- **Asian Options**: Options where the payoff depends on the average price of the underlying asset over a certain period.
- **Barrier Options**: Options that become activated or extinguished when the underlying asset reaches a certain price level.

**Steps**:

1. **Input Parameters**:
   - Same as the Option Pricing Calculator, with the addition of selecting the **Option Style/Type** (American, Asian, Barrier, etc.).
   - **Additional Parameters**: Depending on the exotic option chosen, you may need to input extra parameters (e.g., barrier levels for barrier options).

2. **Automatic Calculation**:
   - The tool automatically calculates the option price as you adjust the inputs.

3. **Results**:
   - **Option Value**: Displays the calculated price for the exotic option.
   - **Parameters Overview**: Shows a summary of input parameters used in the calculation.
